# CitiBike_Challenge
Module 18 Challenge

This repository contains the jupyter notebook for the CitiBike challenge.  The raw files were too large for GitHub. The files were downloaded from the CitiBike system-data website.  The two files used are 202405-citibike-tripdata_1.csv and 202305-citibike-tripdata_1.csv.  They were cleaned and combined with python to be loaded into Tableau.
